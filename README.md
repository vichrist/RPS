# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 

## Game Overview

A simple web-based verson allowing the user to play five rounds of rock, paper, scissors. Each round of game you will be notified whether or not you lost, won or tied the computer. At the end of the game you will be given the stats of your plays. If you choose to play again simply refresh the browser. 

## Code Overview  

Javascript code is not on an external file, as a first-time project code is left within the body of the script tags

The user value will be converted to lower case, if the user enters the value with upper case letters 

Only if the user chooses the options that are available, the if/else statements will be executed 

The game will keep track of wins, losses and ties
